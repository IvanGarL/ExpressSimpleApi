# ExpressSimpleApi
An easy example of how a basic CRUD API to a mongodb works, using NodeJS and Express 

# Steps to test the app.
1. Create a database on Mongo called 'world' with a collection called 'countries'. If possible use MongoDB Compass Community, and rund the db server on localhost:27017.

2. Run the NodeJS app: placed on the main directory open a terminal and type 'node app.js'

3. Open PostMan and test the existing collection, for better results in this order: post, getOne, put, getAll, delete.
